As the name suggests, anything under this folder will be publicly accessible by your website users. CSS, JavaScript and Images will be a part of this folder.

Your app may use tools like Webpack and Gulp which will compile(minify, pre-process) your (S)CSS & JS files and move under the public folder which will later be linked on web pages.

You could also build and output your React (or similar lib/framework) app under the dist/ folder.
